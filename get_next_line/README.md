This project has been created as part of the 42 curriculum by kevnguye@student.42prague.com

# Description
The main purpose of project is to create a program to is able read and returns each line from a file descriptor

The program was created from files named:
- get_next_line.h -> header file for program
- get_next_line.c -> file where the main functions are happening
- get_next_line_utils.c -> functions that were taken from different libraries

## How it is working
Firstly we need file from where we can read and return a line, because without that we can't even begin.

Here's my file named text.txt which I've used for this project
